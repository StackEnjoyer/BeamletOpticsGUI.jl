    export_changes(gui::LiveView; io = stdout, clipboard = false) -> String

Returns the changes of the poses in the `gui` as Julia code, which is printed to `io` and copied to
the clipboard if `clipboard` is `true` and a clipboard is available. The "Export" button of the
`gui` prints the code and copies it to the clipboard.

For each object whose pose differs from its initial pose, i.e. its pose when the window was
opened, the code contains a `rotate3d!` about the position of the object (skipped if the object
was only moved) followed by a `translate_to3d!` to its absolute position [m], with the full
precision of `Float64`. Applied to the objects in their initial poses, e.g. in the script that
created the system, the code reproduces the current poses. The objects of a group are listed after
the group, their changes are relative to the pose after moving the group. Clip planes are not
exported.

The variables are named after the `labels` of [`live_view`](@ref) if they are valid variable names,
otherwise `obj1`, `obj2`, … by the position of the object in the component menu. A comment above
each change names the label and the type of the object.
