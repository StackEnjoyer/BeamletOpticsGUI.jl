    _ProgressOverlay(ax::LScene, theme::NamedTuple = _app_theme(:light))

A small progress window of the live view in the 3D scene of `ax`: a panel with a label, a
progress bar and a button "Cancel" next to an anchor point, e.g. the marker of the source that is being traced, in the
color tokens `theme` of the live view (see `_APP_THEMES`) like the component cards: the panel in
the color of the sidebars with a border, the text, the track of the bar in the color of the
borders and the bar in the orange of the source markers. The button is drawn like the buttons of
the cards; the window only draws it and tells whether the mouse is over it (`_over_cancel`), the
live view cancels the solve on a click, see `_connect_trace!`. The
panel has a fixed size on the screen (about 240 × 50 px, above and to the right of the anchor)
and is drawn on top of the scene. It is drawn in a child scene of the 3D scene with a pixel
camera, at the projection of the anchor, which [`_show_progress!`](@ref) updates, e.g. every frame
while the camera moves; an anchor outside of the view puts the panel at the edge towards it, see
`_screen_anchor`. Its plots come last in the drawing order of GLMakie and in front of the 3D scene
(`_PROGRESS_Z`), so that neither plots added to the 3D scene later, e.g. a sky, nor transparent
plots cover it. As plots of a child scene, they do not enter the limits of the 3D scene.

The constructor adds all plots at once, hidden, [`_show_progress!`](@ref) and
[`_hide_progress!`](@ref) only update observables. The plots are not inspectable and not clipped.

# Fields

- `scene`: the scene of the `LScene`
- `hud`: the child scene with a pixel camera that holds the plots
- `anchor`: the pixel position in `scene` the panel is attached to, `NaN` until first shown
- `fill_size`: width and height of the bar fill in pixels
- `fill_offset`: pixel offset of the center of the bar fill from the anchor
- `label`: text above the bar, e.g. "Tracing beams 42 %"
- `visible`: visibility of all plots
- `hovered`: `true` while the mouse is over the cancel button, which highlights it
- `plots`: panel, bar track, bar fill, label, cancel button and its text
