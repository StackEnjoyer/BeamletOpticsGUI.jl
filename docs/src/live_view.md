# Live view

All examples on this page assume `using GLMakie, BeamletOptics, BeamletOpticsGUI` and a `system` and `beam` (or beam group `source`) built with BeamletOptics.

[`live_view`](@ref) combines `live_render!`, [`kinematic_controls!`](@ref), detector
panels and optional sliders into a single ready-to-use window. It is the fastest way to explore
the sensitivity of a system in the REPL: grab a mirror, watch the beam path and the detector
panels update live.

```julia
using GLMakie, BeamletOptics, BeamletOpticsGUI

gui = live_view(system, beam)
display(gui)
```

With GLMakie, `display(gui)` opens the window without SSAO and with up to 60 fps, since SSAO (e.g.
enabled globally via `GLMakie.activate!(ssao = true)`) multiplies the frame time with large meshes
such as a housing, and GLMakie's default of 30 fps makes rotating the view sluggish. Screen settings
passed to `display(gui; ...)` override these defaults. For static renders with SSAO, pass it to the
display of that figure only, e.g. `display(fig; ssao = true)`.

A [view cube](@ref "View cube") in the top right corner of the 3D view switches to the standard
views with a click, clicks on the cube never select or deselect a component. The live view starts
in the isometric view from the corner between `Top`, `Front` and `Right`, i.e. from `(1, -1, 1)`,
such that the labels of the cube read correctly. The "orthographic" toggle below the 3D view,
next to "auto trace" and "clip beams", switches between perspective and orthographic projection,
`orthographic = true` starts with the latter. Moving along the view direction does not change an
orthographic view, there `W`/`S` zoom like `U`/`O`:

```julia
gui = live_view(system, beam; orthographic = true)
```

More than one `system => beam` pair can be shown in the same 3D view, e.g. the transmitter and
receiver path of a lidar, which are solved with different sources:

```julia
gui = live_view(system_tx => beam_tx, system_rx => source_rx)
```

## Movable sources in the live view

Each source, i.e. the beam or beam group of each `system => beam` pair, is shown with an orange
marker at its position, which points along its direction. A source is selected and moved via its
marker like any component, after which the systems are solved again. For a beam, which only has a
direction, the green axis is its direction. If a marker covers small components, the "sources"
toggle below the 3D view or the key `1` hides all markers and shows them again, `show_sources =
false` starts with hidden markers. Pass `movable_sources = false` to omit the markers altogether.

## Extras and static context

Objects that are not part of any `system`, e.g. a housing from a CAD file, are passed as `extras`,
each optionally with the kwargs of its `render!` call:

```julia
housing = MeshDummy("housing.stl")
gui = live_view(system => beam; extras = [housing => (; transparency = true, color = (:gray, 0.3))])
```

Extras are never traced, so they cost nothing in the solves, and moving them does not solve the
systems. Otherwise they act like components: they are selected with a click, in the component menu
or in the object tree (under "Extras"), moved, hidden and exported. They do not block clicking on
the optics behind them: objects are picked by intersecting the camera ray with the optical
components first, which a `NonInteractableObject` never intersects. The card of a
`NonInteractableObject` (e.g. a `MeshDummy`) or an `IntersectableObject` has an "opacity" slider,
which makes it transparent without changing the optics; 0 % hides it. Below 50 % opacity, a click
in the 3D view passes through such an object, i.e. a click into the empty space inside a
transparent housing does not select the housing; select it in the object tree or the component
menu instead. Visible extras count towards the size of the scene, which sets the size of the
source markers and of new clip planes and the view of "fit all" (`g` without a selection).

Plots added directly to `gui.ax` via `render!` are only drawn, i.e. they are neither selectable nor
hideable:

```julia
render!(gui.ax, housing_mesh; transparency = true, color = (:gray, 0.3))
```

## Clip planes

Clip planes cut the 3D view open, e.g. to look into a housing or behind a component. Only the side
of a plane its normal points to stays visible. `p` adds a plane through the selected component, or
through the point the camera looks at if nothing is selected, with its normal along the view
direction. A plane is selected via the purple handle at its center and moved and rotated like a
component, its normal is the green axis. Moving a plane does not solve the systems.

| Input      | Action                                                  |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| `p`        | Add a clip plane and select it                          |
| `Delete`   | Remove the selected clip plane                          |
| `c`        | Switch clipping on or off (all planes)                  |
| `Shift+c`  | Flip the selected clip plane, i.e. show the other side  |

Planes can also be given at construction as `point => normal`. The beams are not clipped unless
`clip_beams = true` or the "clip beams" toggle below the 3D view is switched on, the markers of
the sources and planes are never clipped:

```julia
gui = live_view(system, beam; clip_planes = [[0, 0.1, 0] => [0, 1, 0]], clip_beams = true)
```

Makie supports at most 8 clip planes. The selection box of a partly clipped component only covers
its visible part.

## Detector panels

By default (`detectors = :auto`), one panel is shown for every `Detector` of every system,
deduplicated by identity. Each panel shows the spot diagram (`:spot`) for ray-based hits or the
intensity (`:intensity`) for Gaussian beamlet hits, chosen automatically (`:auto`). Pass a vector
to select detectors and modes explicitly, or `[]` to disable the panels:

```julia
gui = live_view(system, beam; detectors = [pd1, pd2 => :spot, pd3 => (:intensity, (; n = 200))])
```

The `kwargs` of the `pd => (mode, kwargs)` form are passed to `intensity`; most useful is
a fixed extent via `x_min`, `x_max`, `z_min` and `z_max` (in meters, like the rest of this
package), instead of the automatic crop around the beam.

The subtitle of each panel shows its metrics for alignment, the centroid is marked by a red cross:

- spot diagram: the number of hits `N`, the centroid `c`, the RMS radius `sqrt(mean(|p - c|²))`
  and the geometric radius, i.e. the largest distance from the centroid
- intensity: the power `P`, the peak intensity, the centroid `c` and the 1/e² radii `w` along x
  and z, i.e. twice the standard deviation of the intensity along each axis

The following panel options are not passed to `intensity`:

| Option                  | Effect                                                               |
|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `colorscale = :log`     | shows `log10` of the intensity, with a floor of 1e-4 times the maximum |
| `colorrange = (lo, hi)` | fixed color range of the intensity (in `log10` units for `:log`)     |
| `history = true`        | adds an axis with the power (or `N`) and the centroid over the last 300 full solves |
| `profiles = true`       | adds an axis with the intensity along x and z through the centroid   |

```julia
gui = live_view(system, beam; detectors = [pd => (:intensity, (; colorscale = :log, history = true, profiles = true))])
```

## Sliders

`sliders` adds custom parameters below the 3D view. Each entry is `"label" => (range, callback)`
(or `(range, callback, startvalue)`); `callback` is called with the current slider value and is
expected to move objects or otherwise change the system:

```julia
gui = live_view(system, beam;
    sliders = ["focus [mm]" => (-1:0.01:4, v -> set_focus(cl, v * 1e-3))])
```

Since this package uses SI units throughout, a slider that is labeled and ranged in millimeters
for convenience must convert its value before applying it, as in `v * 1e-3` above.

## Custom updates

`on_change = (gui, obj) -> ...` is called after every full solve, with the moved object or
`nothing` (initial solve, or after a slider change). It is not called after the preview solves of
beam groups while moving, see [Manual tracing](@ref), but once the full solve follows. Use it to
record derived quantities, e.g. the optical power on a detector over time, which an own panel
plots, see [Own panels, controls and tools](@ref):

```julia
power = Point2f[]

function record_power!(gui, obj)
    push!(power, Point2f(length(power) + 1, 1e3 * optical_power(pd)))
    return nothing
end

gui = live_view(system, beam; on_change = record_power!)
```

Errors raised inside `on_change` are logged once and do not interrupt the interaction. See the
[Interactive Michelson interferometer](@ref) example for a full callback that tracks the optical
power over time.

## Own panels, controls and tools

Own parts are added to a `gui = live_view(...)` by three functions, which work with both layouts;
the layout decides where the parts go:

| function | `layout = :compact` | `layout = :app` |
|:--|:--|:--|
| [`add_panel!`](@ref) | below the detector panels, right of the 3D view | a tab of the analysis dock |
| [`add_controls!`](@ref) | a row above the status row | a section of the left sidebar, below "Parameters" |
| [`add_tool!`](@ref) | a button (or toggle) in the row below the status line | an icon button (or toggle) in the toolbar, before "Help" |

`add_panel!(f, gui, title)` calls `f(layout)` with the `GridLayout` of the new panel, into which it
builds e.g. an `Axis` with plots. The function returned by `f` is called with the `gui` after each
full solve, like `on_change`, and once right away. In the app layout, only the panel of the shown
tab is updated, hidden panels when their tab is opened, i.e. hidden panels cost nothing. The new tab
stays in the background unless `select = true`:

```julia
add_panel!(gui, "Optical power") do layout
    ax = Axis(layout[1, 1]; xlabel = "Update", ylabel = "P [mW]")
    pts = Observable(copy(power))
    lines!(ax, pts)
    return gui -> (pts[] = copy(power); autolimits!(ax))
end
```

Data that must be recorded after every solve, also while the panel is hidden, is recorded by
`on_change`, as above, and only plotted by the panel. In the compact layout, the panels are placed
in a grid in `gui.fig[1, 2]`; an axis at `gui.fig[1, 2][2, 1]`, below a single detector panel,
works as well, but only `add_panel!` works with both layouts.

`add_controls!(f, gui, title)` calls `f(layout)` to build widgets, e.g. buttons, menus and
textboxes. While a textbox of the controls is focused or a menu is open, the keys of the 3D view and
the camera are ignored, as for the boxes of the live view. A change of the optics from such a
widget calls [`retrace!`](@ref), which solves the systems again like after a slider of the
`sliders` kwarg (or marks the beams as outdated with `auto_trace = false`); the change itself goes
into its first argument, since objects must not change while a solve runs in the background. Like
the builder of `add_panel!`, `f` may return a function `update(gui)`, which is called after each
full solve and once right away, e.g. to show the current value of a parameter. Controls are meant
for parameters without a scene object; the widgets of an object belong on its card, see
[Cards and widgets](@ref):

```julia
add_controls!(gui, "Mirror") do layout
    box = Textbox(layout[1, 1]; placeholder = "tilt [mrad]", width = 100)
    on(box.stored_string) do s
        θ = tryparse(Float64, s)
        isnothing(θ) || retrace!(() -> zrotate3d!(m1, 1e-3 * θ), gui)
    end
end
```

`add_tool!(f, gui, name)` adds a button that calls `f(gui)`, with `toggle = true` a toggle that
calls `f(gui, active)`. In the app layout, it is an icon of the toolbar (`icon`, e.g. `:measure`,
`:export` or `:chart`, an unknown name lists the valid ones, or an own `Makie.BezierPath`) with a
`tooltip`. `key` binds a key of
the 3D view to the tool; keys that the live view, the kinematic controls or the camera use (all
letters) throw an `ArgumentError` naming the binding, e.g. the digits `2`–`9` or the function keys
are free:

```julia
add_tool!(gui, "Center m1"; icon = :fit, key = Keyboard._2) do gui
    retrace!(() -> translate_to3d!(m1, [0, 0.1, 0]), gui)
end
# Shows or hides a reference line along the optical axis
ref = lines!(gui.ax, [Point3f(0, 0, 0), Point3f(0, 0.3, 0)]; color = :gray, visible = false)
add_tool!(gui, "Optical axis"; toggle = true, key = Keyboard._3) do gui, active
    ref.visible[] = active
end
```

## Manual tracing

Solving a large system on every mouse-drag event can be too slow for smooth interaction. With
`auto_trace = false`, `live_view` still updates the 3D view and the sliders immediately, but only
solves the systems (and updates the beams and detector panels) on request: the `Trace (t)` button
below the 3D view, the key `t`, or switching the "auto trace" toggle back on (which solves once if
the state is outdated). While outdated, the beam plots are dimmed and the status line shows a
hint. The initial solve always runs, regardless of `auto_trace`.

With `auto_trace = true`, `live_view` adapts to slow systems as well: if solving takes longer than
`trace_budget` (30 ms by default), the components still follow the mouse immediately, while the
systems are solved once the movement pauses for `idle_delay` (0.2 s). Likewise, detector panels
that take longer than `trace_budget` show a coarse preview while moving, which is refined once the
movement pauses.

Beam groups, e.g. a source with thousands of rays, are rendered with `render_every = 5` by
default, i.e. only every fifth beam is drawn. While a component is moved, such groups are only
solved for the rendered beams (preview tracing), the other beams are reset and do not hit the
detectors; the titles of the detector panels end with "(preview)". Once the movement pauses for
`idle_delay`, the full group is solved. The `trace_budget` applies to the preview solve while
moving, such that large groups stay interactive. `preview = false` always solves the full groups:

```julia
gui = live_view(system, source; beam_kwargs = Dict(source => (; render_every = 50)), preview = false)
```

Solves longer than `progress_delay` run in the background with a progress window next to the
source or detector, see "Long solves" in the docstring of [`live_view`](@ref).

## Component card and component menu

Selecting a component, source or clip plane opens a card next to its bounding box in the 3D view,
connected to it by a line. The card follows the camera and the component and stays inside the
view, off the view cube and the other cards. With `theme = :light` (default) or `:dark`, the whole
window has the colors of the theme, i.e. the cards, the menus, the buttons and the status row, in
the compact layout as well as in the app layout. Objects without an entry in `labels` are named by
their type and a running index, e.g. "Mirror 1" or "Clip plane 2", in the card, the status line and
the menus, like in the object tree of the app layout:

- The head shows the icon of the kind of the component, its label and "hide", which hides it, e.g. a mirror in front of
  the component of interest, and clears the selection. A hidden component can not be selected in
  the 3D view, but stays in the systems, i.e. it is still traced. Selected in the menu, its card
  reads "show", which shows it again. For a clip plane, the head holds "flip" and "remove".
- `x`, `y`, `z` [mm] show the position of the component. Typing a value and pressing `Enter`
  moves the component to this absolute coordinate. The boxes `rx`, `ry` and `rv` [mrad] rotate it
  by the typed angle about the red, green and blue axis of the controls, like the arrow keys in the
  rotate mode, e.g. `rv = 1` equals one key step with a step of 1 mrad. Each input is a step of the
  undo history, the constraints of the component apply. While a box is focused, the keys of the 3D
  view are ignored.
- Only the card of the selection has, below its rows, the `step` box of the keyboard step, see
  below, the "Move"/"Rotate" control and a "Properties" part. The control shows the mode of the
  controls and sets it, and follows the key `m` and vice versa. "Properties", collapsed by default,
  is expanded by its chevron and lists the properties of the object (see `properties`),
  the same rows as the inspector of the app layout; it stays expanded or collapsed while the card
  follows the selection. Pinned cards have neither the step, the mode nor the properties.
- The chevron at the right end of the head collapses the card to its head and expands it again.
- The pin keeps the card with its component when the selection changes, e.g. to watch or type the
  poses of several components; the widgets of a pinned card act on its component. Clicking the
  pin again closes it.
- Dragging the head (icon, label or the free room around them) moves the card to another place in
  the view, e.g. to line up several pinned cards at an edge. It stays there, connected to its
  component by the line, when the camera or the component moves and when it is pinned; the card of
  the selection also keeps its place for the next selected component. The place is kept relative
  to the nearest corner of the view, so a card at an edge stays there when the window is resized.
  A double click on the head places the card next to its component again, as does unpinning it.
- Below the pose, rows of the component type, refreshed after each solve and move:

  | Component | Rows |
  |:----------|:-----|
  | optical components | `beam`: the rays hitting it in the last solve and the angle of incidence of the first one (e.g. the center ray of a ring source) with the range of all, or "not hit" |
  | lenses, prisms | `n` at the wavelength of the hitting beam, `d` the center thickness (`Lens`) |
  | beamsplitters | `split`: R and T (power) of the coating |
  | polarizers | `axis`: the transmission axis about the optical axis, from the horizontal |
  | detectors | `signal`: the power (intensity panel) or the number of rays (spot panel); `panel`: a button that cycles the mode of its detector panel (`auto`, `spot`, `intensity`) and a toggle of the logarithmic color scale, "no panel" for a detector without a panel (see "Detector panels") |
  | ray sources | `λ` and the diameter or NA; sources whose rays can be regenerated (`CollimatedSource`, `PointSource` and their uniform variants, see `set_num_rays!`) add the slider "rays" for their number of rays, which solves again |
  | Gaussian beamlets | `λ`, the waist `w0` and the Rayleigh range `zR` |

The rows and the buttons in the head are declared per type by multiple dispatch, see
[`card_rows`](@ref) and [`card_actions`](@ref): each row is a [`CardRow`](@ref) of texts and
[`CardWidget`](@ref)s, i.e. any `Makie` widget with a function for the value it shows and one for
its input. The card places the widgets, hides them and keeps their clicks and keys from the 3D
view. An own component adds its rows to the pose rows, e.g.

```julia
BeamletOpticsGUI.card_rows(l::MyLens) = (pose_card_rows(l)...,
    CardRow("f", CardWidget(Label; value = (gui, l) -> "$(round(1e3 * focal_length(l); digits = 2)) mm")),
    CardRow("n", CardWidget(Slider; range = 1.4:0.01:1.9, solve = true,
        value = (gui, l) -> refractive_index(l), on = (gui, l, n) -> set_index!(l, n))))
```

where `solve = true` solves the systems again after an input, like a move. The recipes for the card of
an own component or system type, for own widget types and for controls without a scene object are
on the page [Cards and widgets](@ref).

The card of a system shows the number of its objects, the number of rays and the duration of the last
solve. A system is shown by its entry ("System 1", ...) in the component menu (compact layout) or by
a click on its row in the object tree (app layout), without a selection and without a gizmo, i.e.
`gui.controls.selected[]` stays `nothing`. An object that is not movable is shown in the same way
instead of being selected; its pose boxes reject inputs with a message in the status line. `Esc`, a
click on empty space or the selection of an object closes such a card.

With `live_view(...; layout = :app)`, the cards are docked in the "Properties" sidebar instead of
floating next to the components: the card of the selection at the top, with the same rows and
actions, and below it the pinned cards, one below the other, each with its own head (icon, label,
actions, pin and chevron). The pin of the selection pins a card, the pin of a pinned card unpins
it. The sidebar does not scroll: if the cards do not fit, the older pinned cards collapse to their
heads (the one pinned or expanded last stays open) and the property list of the selection is
shortened; a collapsed card is only expanded again by its chevron. The float button in the head of
a pinned card moves it out of the sidebar into the 3D view, where it floats next to its component
as in the compact layout; the dock button in its head moves it back. Only the docked cards take
room in the sidebar. The floating cards and the docked cards are built by the same code from the
same declarations.

The row below the status line holds the component menu and "show all". The menu lists the systems,
each entry followed by its movable components and sources, by their `labels` (or automatic names),
the objects of a group indented after the group. Selecting an entry selects the component like a
click in the 3D view, a click in the 3D view shows the selected component in the menu; a system
entry shows the card of the system, see above. The menu can be searched by typing while it is open.
Clip planes are not listed. "show all" shows all hidden components. The last cell of the status row
is the info label with the duration of the last solve (or of the preview), the number of rays and
the projection; in the app layout, it is in the status bar.

## Beam inspection and measuring

A click on a beam, within 6 px of a rendered segment, marks the point on the beam and shows in the
status line its position [mm], the direction of the beam, the geometric path length and the
optical path length (Σ n·L) from the source [mm] and, for Gaussian beamlets, the radius `w` and
the radius of curvature `R` at this point (see `BeamletOptics.gauss_parameters`). Components take
precedence over beams, i.e. a click on a component still selects it. `esc` or a click elsewhere
removes the marker.

The "measure" toggle in the row of the component menu switches measuring on: two clicks on
components or beams show the distance between the positions of the components or the points of
the beams [mm], its components Δ, and the angle between the optical axes (local y-axes) of two
components, with a dashed line between the points. A third click starts a new measurement,
switching the toggle off clears it.

Both results are also shown on a card at their points in the 3D view, in the style of the
component cards: "Beam" with the rows `at`, `dir`, `path`, `OPL` (and `w`, `R`) and
"Measurement" with `from`, `to`, `d`, `Δ` (and `angle`). The card is replaced by the next
inspection or measurement and removed with it, unless its pin is clicked: a pinned card stays with
its marker or its line until it is unpinned, so several points and distances can be compared. In
the app layout, a pinned result is docked below the inspector like a pinned component.

## Camera tools

| Input       | Action                                                                     |
|:------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `g`         | Zoom to the selected component, or to all systems, keeping the view direction |
| "home"      | Restore the view when the window was shown                                 |
| "views"     | Set one of the saved views                                                 |
| "save view" | Save the current view as `"view n"` and print it as code for `views`       |

Saved views can be passed to the next session via `views`:

```julia
gui = live_view(system, beam;
    views = ["top" => ([0.0, 0.05, 0.5], [0.0, 0.05, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0])])
```

## Exporting the changes

The "Export" button next to the status line prints the changed poses as Julia code and copies it
to the clipboard, such that an alignment found interactively can be pasted into the script that
builds the system. [`export_changes`](@ref) returns the same code:

```julia
gui = live_view(system, beam; labels = Dict(m1 => "m1", lens => "lens"))
# move the components, then
code = export_changes(gui)
```

```julia
# Changed poses of the live view, apply to the objects in their initial poses.
# Each rotation is about the position of the object, groups are moved before their objects.

# m1 (Mirror)
rotate3d!(m1, [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], 0.0005)
translate_to3d!(m1, [0.0, 0.1000012, 0.0])
```

Each moved object gets a `rotate3d!` about its own position (only if it was rotated) and a
`translate_to3d!` to its absolute position [m], relative to its pose when the window was opened.
Labels that are valid variable names are used as names, other objects are called `obj1`, `obj2`,
… by their position in the component menu. Clip planes are not exported.

## Controls

The 3D view uses the controls of [`kinematic_controls!`](@ref), see
[Kinematic controls](@ref). In addition, the key `t` solves the systems immediately, see
[Manual tracing](@ref), `p`, `Delete`, `c` and `Shift+c` control the clip planes, see
[Clip planes](@ref), `1` shows or hides the source markers, see
[Movable sources in the live view](@ref), and `g` zooms to the selection, see [Camera tools](@ref). The keyboard step can be typed into the box `step` of the component card, e.g.
`250 nm` or `50 µrad`, where the unit selects the move or rotate mode, see
[Component card and component menu](@ref). The status line shows the
pose of the moved component and its change since the window was opened. Names for the status line
and the detector panels are passed via `labels`:

```julia
gui = live_view(system, beam; labels = Dict(m1 => "Mirror 1", pd => "Photodiode"),
    constraints = Dict(m1 => (; move = ())))
```

A complete example, including a custom `on_change` callback, can be found in the
[Interactive Michelson interferometer](@ref) example.
